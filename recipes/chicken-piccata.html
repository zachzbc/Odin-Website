        <h2>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1
                    Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
                <li>Step 2
                    Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
                <li>Step 3
                    Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
